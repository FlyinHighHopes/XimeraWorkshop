    In this activity, we try out something crazy in tikZ. Precisly, we are trying to place an answer box inside of a tikZ node.

\begin{question}
Enter the secret answer!

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[thick] (0,0) circle (0.5); 
        \draw[thick] (0.5,0) -- (9.5,0);
        \draw[thick] (10,0) circle (0.5);
        \node at (2,1) {$\answer{42}$};
        \node at (5,1) {$\answer{42}$};
        \node at (8,1) {$\answer{42}$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    
\end{center}


\end{question}

LESSON: That did not work...And we know that it will never work. Tikz turns its drawn output into a .svg image, so there is no hope of obtaining an answer box in the final html output.
